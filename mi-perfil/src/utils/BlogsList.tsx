          "Grids are one of the most (if not the most) used medium of displaying structured data to users. In React, there are third party components available to make your job easier. In my opinion, you should go for these only when there is a large amount of data to be displayed (e.g., data with  more than 15-20 columns or with dynamic column headers or both). react-virtualized by Brian Vaughn and fixed-data-table-2 are some of the popular packages that you could consider for displaying large amount of data. With these packages, note that every cell is a component and if you do not control the rendering, every cell will render on every change which will slow down the app. Of course, there are options to control the rendering and those should be used wisely. In this series though, we will build a small grid with known table headers, and discuss common functionalities like pagination, search, sort, etc. The code is available for reference ",

          "To get started swiftly, I have used the create react-app utility to bootsrap the project. All react files pertaining to this project are under the src/components/Grid folder. GridMain component will be our parent component which will call the external api, and hold the methods of any data manipulation. Grid component will be the main component for our reusable grid while GridRow component will represent each row of the grid. There is also a common CSS file. "

There are a few changes that I want to make for some of the values - I don't want the year value to be present in date as well as format the date, I want "First Stage" to be called "Group Stage", "Match for third place" as "Third Place", and I also want to form the score attribute in a <Home Score-Away Score> kind of format.
